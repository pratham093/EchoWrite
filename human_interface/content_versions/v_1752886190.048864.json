In 1674, he was formally crowned the\nChhatrapati\nof his realm at\nRaigad Fort\n.\n[\n8\n]\nShivaji offered passage and his service to the Mughal emperor\nAurangzeb\nto invade the declining Sultanate of Bijapur. After Aurangzeb's departure for the north due to a war of succession, Shivaji conquered territories ceded by Bijapur in the name of the Mughals.\n[\n9\n]\n: 63\nFollowing his defeat at the hands of\nJai Singh I\n, the senior most general (\"\nMirza\nRaja\n\") of the\nMughal Empire\n, in the\nBattle of Purandar\n, Shivaji entered into vassalage with the Mughal empire, assuming the role of a Mughal chief and was conferred with the title of\nRaja\nby Aurangzeb.\n[\n10\n]\nHe undertook military expeditions on behalf of the Mughal Empire for a brief duration.\n[\n11\n]\nOver the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the\nSultanate of Golconda\n, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the\nEuropean colonial powers\n.\nIn 1674, Shivaji was crowned as the king despite opposition from local Brahmins.\n[\n9\n]\n: 87\n[\n12\n]\nPraised for his chivalrous treatment of women,\n[\n13\n]\nShivaji employed people of all castes and religions, including Muslims\n[\n14\n]\nand Europeans, in his administration and armed forces.\n[\n15\n]\nShivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a\nMaratha navy\n.\nShivaji's legacy was revived by\nJyotirao Phule\nabout two centuries after his death. Later on, he came to be glorified by Indian nationalists such as\nBal Gangadhar Tilak\n, and appropriated by Hindutva activists.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\nEarly life\nMain article:\nEarly life of Shivaji\nSee also:\nBhonsle § origin\nShivaji was born in the hill-fort of\nShivneri\n, near\nJunnar\n, which is now in\nPune district\n. Scholars disagree on his date of birth; the\nGovernment of Maharashtra\nlists 19 February as a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (\nShivaji Jayanti\n).\n[\na\n]\n[\n27\n]\n[\n28\n]\nShivaji was named after a local deity, the\nGoddess\nShivai Devi.\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nShivaji belonged to a\nMaratha\nfamily of the\nBhonsle\nclan.\n[\n31\n]\nShivaji's father,\nShahaji Bhonsle\n, was a\nMaratha\ngeneral who served the\nDeccan Sultanates\n.\n[\n32\n]\nHis mother was\nJijabai\n, the daughter of\nLakhuji Jadhavrao\nof\nSindhkhed\n, a Mughal-aligned\nsardar\nclaiming descent from a\nYadava\nroyal family of\nDevagiri\n.\n[\n33\n]\n[\n34\n]\nHis paternal grandfather\nMaloji\n(1552–1597) was an influential general of\nAhmadnagar Sultanate\n, and was awarded the epithet of \"\nRaja\n\". He was given\ndeshmukhi\nrights of Pune, Supe, Chakan, and Indapur to provide for military expenses. He was also given\nShivneri fort\nfor his family's residence (\nc.\n1590\n).\n[\n35\n]\n[\n36\n]\nAt the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates:\nBijapur\n,\nAhmednagar\n,\nGolkonda\n; and the\nMughal Empire\n. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshahi of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his\njagir\n(fiefdom) at\nPune\nand his small army.\n[\n32\n]\nScholar\nJames Laine\nstates that Shivaji was imbued with the dream of re-establishing a Hindu kingdom by his mother, Jijabai, who was aware of her\nYadava\nheritage and considered her husband \"a collaborator of low birth.\"\n[\n37\n]\nAncestry\nAncestors of Shivaji\n8.Babaji\n4.\nMaloji\n2.\nShahaji\n5.Uma Bai\n1.\nShivaji I\n12.Vithoji\n6.\nLakhuji Jadhav\n13.Thakrai\n3.\nJijabai\n7. Mahalsabai Jadhav\nShivneri Fort\nConflict with Bijapur Sultanate\nBackground and context\nIn 1636, the\nSultanate of Bijapur\ninvaded the kingdoms to its south.\n[\n7\n]\nThe sultanate had recently become a tributary state of the\nMughal Empire\n.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n38\n]\nIt was being helped by Shahaji, who at the time was a chieftain in the\nMaratha uplands\nof western India. Shahaji was looking for opportunities of rewards of\njagir\nland in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an annuity.\n[\n7\n]\nShahaji was a rebel from brief Mughal service. Shahaji's campaigns against the Mughals, supported by the Bijapur government, were generally unsuccessful. He was constantly pursued by the Mughal army, and Shivaji and his mother Jijabai had to move from fort to fort.\n[\n39\n]\nYoung Shivaji (right) meets his father\nShahaji\n. (left)\nIn 1636, Shahaji joined in the service of Bijapur and obtained\nPoona\nas a grant. Shahaji, being deployed in\nBangalore\nby the Bijapuri ruler Adilshah, appointed\nDadoji Kondadeo\nas Poona's administrator. Shivaji and Jijabai settled in Poona.\n[\n40\n]\nKondadeo died in 1647 and Shivaji took over its administration. One of his first acts directly challenged the Bijapuri government.\n[\n41\n]\nIndependent generalship\nIn 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji captured the\nTorna Fort\nthrough stratagem or bribery,\n[\n9\n]\n: 61\ntaking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the Bijapur court due to the illness of\nSultan Mohammed Adil Shah\n, and seized the large treasure he found there.\n[\n42\n]\n[\n43\n]\nIn the following two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune, including\nPurandar\n,\nKondhana\n, and\nChakan\n. He also brought areas east of Pune around\nSupa\n,\nBaramati\n, and\nIndapur\nunder his direct control. He used the treasure found at Torna to build a new fort named\nRajgad\n. That fort served as the seat of his government for over a decade.\n[\n42\n]\nAfter this, Shivaji turned west to the\nKonkan\nand took possession of the important town of\nKalyan\n. The Bijapur government took note of these happenings and sought to take action. On 25 July 1648, Shahaji was imprisoned by a fellow Maratha sardar called Baji Ghorpade, under the orders of the Bijapur government, in a bid to contain Shivaji.\n[\n44\n]\nMap of Southern India\nc.\n1605\nShahaji was released in 1649, after the capture of\nJinji\nsecured Adilshah's position in Karnataka. During 1649–1655, Shivaji paused in his conquests and quietly consolidated his gains.\n[\n45\n]\nFollowing his father's release, Shivaji resumed raiding, and in 1656, under controversial circumstances, killed\nChandrarao More\n, a fellow Maratha feudatory of Bijapur, and seized the valley of\nJavali\n, near the present-day hill station of\nMahabaleshwar\n.\n[\n46\n]\nThe conquest of Javali allowed Shivaji to extend his raids into south and southwest Maharashtra. In addition to the Bhonsle and the More families, many others—including\nSawant\nof\nSawantwadi\n, Ghorpade of\nMudhol\n,\nNimbalkar\nof\nPhaltan\n, Shirke, Gharge of  Nimsod, Mane, and\nMohite\n—also served Adilshahi of Bijapur, many with\nDeshmukhi\nrights. Shivaji adopted different strategies to subdue these powerful families, such as forming marital alliances, dealing directly with village Patils to bypass the Deshmukhs, or subduing them by force.\n[\n47\n]\nShahaji in his later years had an ambivalent attitude toward his son, and  disavowed his rebellious activities.\n[\n48\n]\nHe told the Bijapuris to do whatever they wanted with Shivaji.\n[\n48\n]\nShahaji died around 1664–1665 in a hunting accident.\n[\n49\n]\nCombat with Afzal Khan\nMain article:\nBattle of Pratapgarh\nAn early-20th-century painting by\nSawlaram Haldankar\nof Shivaji fighting the Bijapuri general Afzal Khan\nPratapgad\nfort\nThe Bijapur Sultanate was displeased with their losses to Shivaji's forces, with their vassal Shahaji disavowing his son's actions. After a peace treaty with the Mughals, and the general acceptance of the young\nAli Adil Shah II\nas the sultan, the Bijapur government became more stable, and turned its attention towards Shivaji.\n[\n50\n]\nIn 1657, the sultan, or more likely his mother and regent, sent\nAfzal Khan\n, a veteran general, to arrest Shivaji. Before engaging him, the Bijapuri forces desecrated the\nTulja Bhavani Temple\n, a holy site for Shivaji's family, and the\nVithoba temple\nat\nPandharpur\n, a major pilgrimage site for Hindus.\n[\n51\n]\n[\n52\n]\n[\n53\n]\nPursued by Bijapuri forces, Shivaji retreated to\nPratapgad\nfort, where many of his colleagues pressed him to surrender.\n[\n54\n]\nThe two forces found themselves at a stalemate, with Shivaji unable to break the siege, while Afzal Khan, having a powerful cavalry but lacking siege equipment, was unable to take the fort. After two months, Afzal Khan sent an envoy to Shivaji suggesting the two leaders meet in private, outside the fort, for negotiations.\n[\n55\n]\n[\n56\n]\nThe two met in a hut in the foothills of Pratapgad fort on 10 November 1659. The arrangements had dictated that each come armed only with a sword, and attended by one follower. Shivaji, suspecting Afzal Khan would arrest or attack him,\n[\n57\n]\n[\nb\n]\nwore armour beneath his clothes, concealed a\nbagh nakh\n(metal \"tiger claw\") on his left arm, and had a dagger in his right hand.\n[\n59\n]\nWhat transpired is not known with historical certainty, mainly Maratha legends tell the tale; however, it is agreed that the two wound up in a physical struggle that proved fatal for Khan.\n[\nc\n]\nKhan's dagger failed to pierce Shivaji's armour, but Shivaji disembowelled him; Shivaji then fired a cannon to signal his hidden troops to attack the Bijapuri army.\n[\n61\n]\nIn the ensuing\nBattle of Pratapgarh\n, Shivaji's forces decisively defeated the Bijapur Sultanate's forces. More than 3,000 soldiers of the Bijapur army were killed; and one sardar of high rank, two sons of Afzal Khan, and two Maratha chiefs were taken prisoner.\n[\n62\n]\nAfter the victory, a grand review was held by Shivaji below Pratapgarh. The captured enemy, both officers and men, were set free and sent back to their homes with money, food, and other gifts. Marathas were rewarded accordingly.\n[\n62\n]\nSiege of Panhala\nHaving defeated the Bijapuri forces sent against him, Shivaji and his army marched towards the\nKonkan\ncoast and\nKolhapur\n, seizing\nPanhala fort\n, and defeating Bijapuri forces sent against them, under\nRustam Zaman\nand Fazl Khan, in 1659.\n[\n63\n]\nIn 1660, Adilshah sent his general Siddi Jauhar to attack Shivaji's southern border, in alliance with the Mughals who planned to attack from the north. At that time, Shivaji was encamped at Panhala fort with his forces. Siddi Jauhar's army besieged\nPanhala\nin mid-1660, cutting off supply routes to the fort. During the bombardment of Panhala, Siddi Jauhar purchased grenades from the English\nEast India Company\n(EIC) factory at\nRajapur\n. He also hired several English artillerymen to assist in his bombardment of the fort, conspicuously flying the\nflag of the East India Company\n. This perceived betrayal angered Shivaji, who in retaliation plundered the factory in December and detained four of its employees, imprisoning them until mid-1663.\n[\n64\n]\nAfter months of siege, Shivaji negotiated with Siddi Jauhar and handed over the fort on 22 September 1660, withdrawing to Vishalgad;\n[\n65\n]\nShivaji retook Panhala in 1673.\n[\n66\n]\nBattle of Pavan Khind\nMain article:\nBattle of Pavan Khind\nShivaji escaped from Panhala by cover of night, and as he was pursued by the enemy cavalry, his Maratha sardar\nBaji Prabhu Deshpande\nof Bandal\nDeshmukh\n, along with 300 soldiers, volunteered to fight to the death to hold back the enemy at Ghod Khind (\"horse ravine\") to give Shivaji and the rest of the army a chance to reach the safety of the\nVishalgad\nfort.\n[\n67\n]\nIn the ensuing\nbattle of Pavan Khind\n, the smaller Maratha force held back the larger enemy to buy time for Shivaji to escape. Baji Prabhu Deshpande was wounded but continued to fight until he heard the sound of cannon fire from Vishalgad,\n[\n31\n]\nsignalling Shivaji had safely reached the fort, on the evening of 13 July 1660.\n[\n68\n]\nGhod Khind\n(\nkhind\nmeaning \"a narrow mountain pass\") was later renamed\nPaavan Khind\n(\"sacred pass\") in honour of Bajiprabhu Deshpande, Shibosingh Jadhav, Fuloji, and all other soldiers who fought there.\n[\n68\n]\nConflict with the Mughals\nShivaji with his personal guards by Mir Muhammad c. 1672\nUntil 1657, Shivaji maintained peaceful relations with the Mughal Empire. Shivaji offered his assistance to\nAurangzeb\n, the son of the Mughal Emperor and\nviceroy\nof the Deccan, in conquering Bijapur, in return for formal recognition of his right to the Bijapuri forts and villages in his possession. Dissatisfied with the Mughal response, and receiving a better offer from Bijapur, he launched a raid into the Mughal Deccan.\n[\n69\n]\nShivaji's confrontations with the Mughals began in March 1657, when two of Shivaji's officers raided the Mughal territory near\nAhmednagar\n.\n[\n70\n]\nThis was followed by raids in\nJunnar\n, with Shivaji carrying off 300,000\nhun\nin cash and 200 horses.\n[\n71\n]\nAurangzeb responded to the raids by sending Nasiri Khan, who defeated the forces of Shivaji at Ahmednagar. However, Aurangzeb's countermeasures against Shivaji were interrupted by the rainy season and his battles with his brothers over the succession to the Mughal throne, following the illness of the emperor\nShah Jahan\n.\n[\n72\n]\nAttacks on Shaista Khan and Surat\nMain articles:\nBattle of Chakan\nand\nBattle of Surat\nA 20th century depiction  of Shivaji's surprise attack on Mughal general Shaista Khan in Pune by\nM.V. Dhurandhar\nAt the request of Badi Begum of Bijapur, Aurangzeb, now the Mughal emperor, sent his maternal uncle\nShaista Khan\n, with an army numbering over 150,000, along with a powerful artillery division, in January 1660 to attack Shivaji in conjunction with Bijapur's army led by Siddi Jauhar. Shaista Khan, with his better equipped and well provisioned army of 80,000 seized Pune. He also took the nearby fort of\nChakan\n, besieging it for a month and a half before breaching the walls.\n[\n73\n]\nHe established his residence at Shivaji's palace of\nLal Mahal\n.\n[\n74\n]\nOn the night of 5 April 1663, Shivaji led a daring night attack on Shaista Khan's camp.\n[\n75\n]\nHe, along with 400 men, attacked Shaista Khan's mansion, broke into Khan's bedroom and wounded him. Khan lost three fingers.\n[\n76\n]\nIn the scuffle, Shaista Khan's son and several wives, servants, and soldiers were killed.\n[\n77\n]\nThe Khan took refuge with the Mughal forces outside of Pune, and Aurangzeb punished him for this embarrassment with a transfer to\nBengal\n.\n[\n78\n]\nIn retaliation for Shaista Khan's attacks, and to replenish his now-depleted treasury, in 1664 Shivaji\nsacked the port city of Surat\n, a wealthy Mughal trading centre and decamped with plunder exceeding Rs 10 million.\n[\n79\n]\n[\n80\n]\nOn 13 February 1665, he also conducted a\nnaval raid\non\nPortuguese\n-held\nBasrur\nin present-day Karnataka, and gained a large plunder.\n[\n81\n]\n[\n82\n]\nTreaty of Purandar\nMain article:\nTreaty of Purandar (1665)\nShivaji submits to Jai Singh\nRaja\nJai Singh\nof Amber receiving Shivaji a day before concluding the\nTreaty of Purandar\nThe attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat enraged Aurangzeb. In response, he sent the\nRajput\ngeneral\nJai Singh I\nwith an army numbering around 15,000 to defeat Shivaji.\n[\n83\n]\nThroughout 1665, Jai Singh's forces pressed Shivaji, with their cavalry razing the countryside, and besieging Shivaji's forts. The Mughal commander succeeded in luring away several of Shivaji's key commanders, and many of his cavalrymen, into Mughal service. By mid-1665, with the fortress at Purandar besieged and near capture, Shivaji was forced to come to terms with Jai Singh.\n[\n83\n]\nShivaji is noted to have said when receiving Jai Singh \"I have come as a guilty slave to seek forgiveness, and it is for you to pardon or kill me at your pleasure.\"\n[\n84\n]\nIn the\nTreaty of Purandar\n, signed by Shivaji and Jai Singh on 11 June 1665, Shivaji agreed to give up 23 of his forts, keeping 12 for himself, and pay compensation of 400,000 gold\nhun\nto the Mughals.\n[\n85\n]\nShivaji agreed to become a vassal of the Mughal empire, and to send his son Sambhaji, along with 5,000 horsemen, to fight for the Mughals in the Deccan, as a\nmansabdar\n.\n[\n86\n]\n[\n87\n]\nSambhaji was taken as a political prisoner to ensure compliance with the treaty. Shivaji himself wished to be excused from attending the court. To this end, he wrote letters to Aurangzeb, requesting forgiveness for his actions and security for himself along with a robe of honour. He also requested Jai Singh to support him in getting his crimes pardoned by the emperor, stating \"Now you are protector and a father to me, so I beg you to fulfil the ambition of your son.\"\n[\n88\n]\n[\n89\n]\nOn 15 September 1665, Aurangzeb granted his request and sent him a letter and a firman along with a robe of honor. Shivaji responded with a letter thanking the emperor:\n[\n84\n]\nShiva, the meanest of life-devoting slaves who wears the ring of servitude in his ear and the carpet of obedience on his shoulder—like an atom ... [acknowledges] the goodnews of his eternal happiness, namely favours from the Emperor ... This sinner and evil-doer did not deserve that his offences should be forgiven or his faults covered up. But the grace and favour of the Emperor have conferred on him a new life and unimaginable honour ...\nArrest in Agra and escape\n20th century depiction by M.V. Dhurandhar of Raja Shivaji at the court of Mughal Badshah, Aurangzeb.\nIn 1666, Aurangzeb summoned Shivaji to\nAgra\n(though some sources instead state Delhi), along with his nine-year-old son Sambhaji. Aurangzeb planned to send Shivaji to\nKandahar\n, now in Afghanistan, to consolidate the Mughal empire's northwestern frontier. However, on 12 May 1666, Shivaji was made to stand at court alongside relatively low-ranking nobles, men he had already defeated in battle.\n[\n90\n]\nShivaji took offence, stormed out,\n[\n91\n]\nand was promptly placed under house arrest. Ram Singh, son of Jai Singh, guaranteed custody of Shivaji and his son.\n[\n92\n]\nThe emperor also withheld the previous honors bestowed upon him such as his robe of honour, elephant and jewels.\n[\n93\n]\n: 211\nShivaji's position under house arrest was perilous, as Aurangzeb's court debated whether to kill him or continue employing him. Jai Singh, having assured Shivaji of his personal safety, tried to influence Aurangzeb's decision. While Shivaji regarded himself as a king, in the eyes of the Mughal emperor, he was only a relatively successful rebel zamindar.\n[\n94\n]\nBy the time the order for his posting to Kabul arrived, a rumor had already spread at the court that Shivaji would be killed along the way. However, the order was canceled when Shivaji refused to go. During the negotiations that followed, Shivaji demanded the transfer of his forts before becoming a mansabdar, a demand the emperor rejected. The orders to kill him were prevented only by Jai Singh's intervention. In the end, Shivaji's request to leave for Banaras as a sannyasi was also rejected.\n[\n94\n]\nMeanwhile, Shivaji hatched a plan to free himself. He sent most of his men back home and asked Ram Singh to withdraw his guarantees to the emperor for the safe custody of himself and his son. He surrendered to Mughal forces.\n[\n95\n]\n[\n96\n]\nShivaji then pretended to be ill and began sending out large baskets packed with sweets to be given to the Brahmins and poor as penance.\n[\n97\n]\n[\n98\n]\n[\n99\n]\nOn 17 August 1666, by putting himself in one of the baskets and his son Sambhaji in another, Shivaji escaped and left Agra.\n[\n100\n]\n[\n101\n]\n[\n102\n]\nStewart Gordon opines that there is no contemporary evidence to support this story. He also states that, despite Aurangzeb's suspicions regarding Ram Singh's involvement in Shivaji's escape, nothing was proven and Shivaji likely bribed the guards to facilitate his escape.\n[\n103\n]\nPeace with the Mughals\nAfter Shivaji's escape, hostilities with the Mughals ebbed, with the Mughal sardar Jaswant Singh acting as an intermediary between Shivaji and Aurangzeb for new peace proposals.\n[\n104\n]\nBetween 1666 and 1668, Aurangzeb also conferred the title of Raja on Shivaji, although he did not restore his right over forts.\n[\n105\n]\nSambhaji was also restored as a\nMughal mansabdar\nwith 5,000 horses. Shivaji at that time sent Sambhaji, with general\nPrataprao Gujar\n, to serve with the Mughal viceroy in Aurangabad,\nPrince Mu'azzam\n. Sambhaji was also granted territory in\nBerar\nfor revenue collection.\n[\n106\n]\nAurangzeb\nalso permitted Shivaji to attack Bijapur, ruled by the decaying\nAdil Shahi dynasty\n; the weakened Sultan\nAli Adil Shah II\nsued for peace and granted the rights of\nsardeshmukhi\nand\nchauthai\nto Shivaji.\n[\n107\n]\nReconquest\nDutch\npainting depicting Shivaji\nc.\n1680\nThe peace between Shivaji and the Mughals lasted until 1670, after which Aurangzeb became suspicious of the close ties between Shivaji and Mu'azzam, who he thought might usurp his throne, and may even have been receiving bribes from Shivaji.\n[\n108\n]\n[\n109\n]\nAlso at that time, Aurangzeb, occupied in fighting the Afghans, greatly reduced his army in the Deccan; many of the disbanded soldiers quickly joined Maratha service.\n[\n110\n]\nThe Mughals also took away the jagir of Berar from Shambhaji to recover the money lent a few years earlier for his father's trip to Agra.\n[\n93\n]\n: 212\n[\n111\n]\nIn response, Shivaji launched an offensive against the Mughals and in a span of four months recovered a major portion of the territories that had been surrendered to them.\n[\n112\n]\nShivaji sacked Surat for a second time in 1670; the English and Dutch factories were able to repel his attack, but he managed to sack the city itself, including plundering the goods of a Muslim prince from\nMawara-un-Nahr\n, who was returning from\nMecca\n. Angered by the renewed attacks, the Mughals resumed hostilities with the Marathas, sending a force under\nDaud Khan\nto intercept Shivaji on his return home from Surat; this force was defeated in the Battle of Vani-Dindori near present-day\nNashik\n.\n[\n113\n]\nIn October 1670, Shivaji sent his forces to harass the English at Bombay; as they had refused to sell him war materiel, his forces blocked English woodcutting parties from leaving Bombay. In September 1671, Shivaji sent an ambassador to Bombay, again seeking materiel, this time for the fight against Danda-Rajpuri. The English had misgivings of the advantages Shivaji would gain from this conquest, but also did not want to lose any chance of receiving compensation for his looting their factories at Rajapur. The English sent Lieutenant Stephen Ustick to treat with Shivaji, but negotiations failed over the issue of the Rajapur indemnity. Numerous exchanges of envoys followed over the coming years, with some agreement as to the arms issues in 1674, but Shivaji was never to pay the Rajapur indemnity before his death, and the factory there dissolved at the end of 1682.\n[\n114\n]\nBattles of Umrani and Nesari\nSee also:\nBattle of Umrani\nIn 1674,\nPrataprao Gujar\n, the\nsarnaubat\n(commander-in-chief of the Maratha forces) and\nAnandrao\n, was sent to push back the invading force led by the Bijapuri general, Bahlol Khan. Prataprao's forces defeated and captured the opposing general in the battle, after cutting-off their water supply by encircling a strategic lake, which prompted Bahlol Khan to sue for peace. In spite of Shivaji's specific warnings against doing so, Prataprao released Bahlol Khan, who started preparing for a fresh invasion.\n[\n115\n]\nShivaji sent a letter to Prataprao, expressing his displeasure and refusing him an audience until Bahlol Khan was re-captured. Upset by this rebuke, Prataprao found Bahlol Khan and charged his position with only six other horsemen, leaving his main force behind, and was killed in combat. Shivaji was deeply grieved on hearing of Prataprao's death, and arranged for the marriage of his second son,\nRajaram\n, to Prataprao's daughter. Prataprao was succeeded by\nHambirrao Mohite\n, as the new\nsarnaubat\n.\nRaigad Fort\nwas newly built by\nHiroji Indulkar\n, as a capital of the nascent Maratha kingdom.\n[\n116\n]\nCoronation\n20th century depiction of the Coronation Durbar with over 100 characters depicted in attendance by M.V. Dhurandhar\nPortrait of Shivaji I c. 1675\nShivaji had acquired extensive lands and wealth through his campaigns, but lacking a formal title, he was still technically a Mughal\nzamindar\nor the son of a Bijapuri\njagirdar\n, with no legal basis to rule his de facto domain. A kingly title could address this and also prevent any challenges by other Maratha leaders, who were his equals.\n[\nd\n]\nSuch a title would also provide the\nHindu Marathis\nwith a fellow Hindu sovereign in a region otherwise ruled by Muslims.\n[\n118\n]\nThe preparation for a proposed coronation began in 1673. However, some controversies delayed the coronation by almost a year.\n[\n119\n]\nOne controversy erupted amongst the\nBrahmins\nof Shivaji's court: they refused to crown Shivaji as a king because that status was reserved for those of the\nkshatriya\nvarna\n(warrior class) in Hindu society.\n[\n120\n]\nShivaji was descended from a line of headmen of farming villages, and the Brahmins accordingly categorized him as a Maratha, not a Kshatriya.\n[\n121\n]\n[\n122\n]\nThey noted that Shivaji had never had a\nsacred thread\nceremony, and did not wear the thread, such as a kshatriya would.\n[\n123\n]\nWhen Shivaji came to know about this conspiracy, he later bribed and summoned\nGaga Bhatt\n, a\npandit\nof Varanasi, who stated that he had found a genealogy proving that Shivaji was descended from the\nSisodias\n, and thus indeed a kshatriya, albeit one in need of the ceremonies befitting his rank.\n[\n124\n]\n[\n125\n]\n[\n126\n]\nTo enforce this status, Shivaji was given a sacred thread ceremony, and remarried his spouses under the\nVedic rites\nexpected of a kshatriya.\n[\n127\n]\n[\n128\n]\nHowever, according to historical evidence, Shivaji's claim to\nRajput\n, and specifically of Sisodia ancestry, may be seen as being anything from tenuous, at best, to purely inventive.\n[\n129\n]\nOn 28 May, Shivaji did penance for his and his ancestors' not observing Kshatriya rites for so long. Then he was invested by Gaga Bhatt with the sacred thread.\n[\n130\n]\nOn the insistence of other Brahmins, Gaga Bhatt omitted the Vedic chant and initiated Shivaji into a modified form of the life of the\ntwice-born\n, instead of putting him on a par with the Brahmins. Next day, Shivaji made atonement for the sins, deliberate or accidental, committed in his own lifetime.\n[\n131\n]\nHe was weighed separately against seven metals including gold, silver, and several other articles, such fine linen, camphor, salt, sugar etc. All these articles, along with a\nlakh\n(one hundred thousand) of hun, were distributed among the Brahmins. According to Sarkar, even this failed to satisfy the greed of the Brahmins. Two of the learned Brahmins pointed out that Shivaji, while conducting his raids, had killed Brahmins, cows, women, and children. He could be cleansed of these sins for a price of\nRs\n. 8,000, which Shivaji paid.\n[\n131\n]\nThe total expenditure for feeding the assemblage, general almsgiving, throne, and ornaments approached 1.5 million\nrupees\n.\n[\n132\n]\nOn 6 June 1674, Shivaji was crowned king of the\nMaratha Empire\n(\nHindavi Swaraj\n) in a lavish ceremony at Raigad fort.\n[\n133\n]\n[\n134\n]\nIn the\nHindu calendar\nit was the 13th day (\ntrayodashi\n) of the first fortnight of the month of\nJyeshtha\nin the year 1596.\n[\n135\n]\nGaga Bhatt officiated, pouring water from a gold vessel filled with the waters of the seven sacred rivers—\nYamuna\n,\nIndus\n,\nGanges\n,\nGodavari\n,\nNarmada\n,\nKrishna\n, and\nKaveri\n—over Shivaji's head, and chanted the Vedic coronation mantras. After the ablution, Shivaji bowed before his mother, Jijabai, and touched her feet. Nearly fifty thousand people gathered at Raigad for the ceremonies.\n[\n136\n]\n[\n137\n]\nShivaji was entitled\nShakakarta\n(\"founder of an era\")\n[\n1\n]\nand\nChhatrapati\n(\"\nLord\nof the\nUmbrella\n\"). He also took the title of\nHaindava Dharmodhhaarak\n(protector of the Hindu faith)\n[\n2\n]\nand\nKshatriya Kulavantas\n:\n[\n3\n]\n[\n138\n]\n[\n139\n]\nKshatriya\nbeing the varna\n[\ne\n]\nof\nHinduism\nand\nkulavantas\nmeaning the 'head of the\nkula\n, or clan'.\n[\n140\n]\nShivaji's mother died on 18 June 1674. The Marathas summoned Nischal Puri Goswami, a tantric priest, who declared that the original coronation had been held under inauspicious stars, and a second coronation was needed. This second coronation, on 24 September 1674, mollified those who still believed that Shivaji was not qualified for the Vedic rites of his first coronation, by being a less controversial ceremony.\n[\n141\n]\n[\n142\n]\n[\n143\n]\nConquest in southern India\nTanjavur Maratha Kingdom\nBeginning in 1674, the Marathas undertook an aggressive campaign, raiding\nKhandesh\n(October), capturing Bijapuri\nPonda\n(April 1675),\nKarwar\n(mid-year), and\nKolhapur\n(July).\n[\n144\n]\nIn November, the Maratha navy skirmished with the\nSiddis\nof\nJanjira\n, but failed to dislodge them.\n[\n145\n]\nHaving recovered from an illness, and taking advantage of a civil war that had broken out between the Deccanis and the Afghans at Bijapur, Shivaji raided\nAthani\nin April 1676.\n[\n146\n]\nIn the run-up to his expedition, Shivaji appealed to a sense of Deccani patriotism, that Southern India was a homeland that should be protected from outsiders.\n[\n147\n]\n[\n148\n]\nHis appeal was somewhat successful, and in 1677 Shivaji visited\nHyderabad\nfor a month and entered into a treaty with the\nQutubshah\nof the Golkonda sultanate, who agreed to renounce his alliance with Bijapur and jointly oppose the Mughals.\nIn 1677, Shivaji invaded Karnataka with 30,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry, backed by Golkonda artillery and funding.\n[\n149\n]\nProceeding south, Shivaji seized the forts of\nVellore\nand\nGingee\n;\n[\n150\n]\nthe latter would later serve as a capital of the Marathas during the reign of his son\nRajaram I\n.\n[\n151\n]\nThis conquest gave him possession of vast territory in Mysore plateau and Madras Carnatic, containing 100 forts.\n[\n79\n]\nShivaji intended to reconcile with his half-brother\nVenkoji\n(Ekoji I), Shahaji's son by his second wife, Tukabai (née\nMohite\n), who ruled\nThanjavur\n(Tanjore) after Shahaji. The initially promising negotiations were unsuccessful, so whilst returning to Raigad, Shivaji defeated his half-brother's army on 26 November 1677 and seized most of his possessions on the\nMysore plateau\n. Venkoji's wife Dipa Bai, whom Shivaji deeply respected, took up new negotiations with Shivaji and also convinced her husband to distance himself from his Muslim advisors. In the end, Shivaji consented to turn over to her and her female descendants many of the properties he had seized, with Venkoji consenting to a number of conditions for the proper administration of the territories and maintenance of\nShahji\n's tomb (\nsamadhi\n).\n[\n152\n]\n[\n153\n]\nDeath and succession\nSambhaji\n, Shivaji's elder son who succeeded him\nSamadhi of Shivaji-I (Memorial)\nThe question of Shivaji's heir-apparent was complicated. In 1678, Shivaji confined his son\nSambhaji\nto\nPanhala Fort\nfor having an addiction to sensual pleasures or violating a Brahmin woman.\n[\n154\n]\nOnly to have the prince escape with his wife and defect to the\nMughals\nwhere he fought against Shivaji in the\nBattle of Bhupalgarh\n. Upon returning home, unrepentant, he was again confined to Panhala Fort.\n[\n155\n]\nShivaji died around 3–5 April 1680 at the age of 50,\n[\n156\n]\nat\nRaigad Fort\n, on the eve of\nHanuman Jayanti\n. The cause of Shivaji's death is disputed. British records states that Shivaji died of\nbloody flux\n, after being sick for 12 days.\n[\nf\n]\nIn a contemporary work in Portuguese, in the Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa, the recorded cause of death of Shivaji is anthrax.\n[\n158\n]\n[\n159\n]\nHowever, Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad, author of\nSabhasad Bakhar\n, a biography of Shivaji has mentioned fever as the cause of death.\n[\n160\n]\n[\n159\n]\nPutalabai\n, the childless eldest of the surviving wives of Shivaji committed\nsati\nby jumping into his funeral pyre. Another surviving spouse, Sakwarbai, was not allowed to follow suit because she had a young daughter.\n[\n155\n]\nThere were also allegations, though doubted by later scholars, that his second wife\nSoyarabai\nhad poisoned him in order to put her 10-year-old son\nRajaram\non the throne.\n[\n161\n]\nAfter Shivaji's death, Soyarabai made plans, with various ministers, to crown her son Rajaram rather than her stepson\nSambhaji\n. On 21 April 1680, ten-year-old Rajaram was installed on the throne. However, Sambhaji took possession of\nRaigad Fort\nafter killing the commander, and on 18 June acquired control of Raigad, and formally ascended the throne on 20 July.\n[\n162\n]\nRajaram, his mother Soyarabai and wife\nJanki Bai\nwere imprisoned, and Soyrabai was executed on charges of conspiracy that October.\n[\n163\n]\nGovernance\nAshta Pradhan Mandal\nMain article:\nAshta Pradhan\nThe Council of Eight Ministers, or\nAshta Pradhan\nMandal\n, was an administrative and advisory council set up by Shivaji.\n[\n164\n]\n[\n165\n]\nIt consisted of eight ministers who regularly advised Shivaji on political and administrative matters. The eight ministers were as follows:\n[\n160\n]\nAshta Pradhan Mandal\nMinister\nDuty\nPeshwa\nor Prime Minister\nGeneral administration\nAmatya\nor Finance Minister\nMaintaining public accounts\nMantri\nor Chronicler\nMaintaining court records\nSummant or\nDabir\nor Foreign Secretary\nAll matters related to relationships with other states\nSachiv\nor Shurn Nawis or Home Secretary\nManaging correspondence of the king\nPanditrao or Ecclesiastical Head\nReligious matters\nNyayadhis or Chief Justice\nCivil and military justice\nSenapati\n/Sari Naubat or Commander-in-Chief\nAll matters related to army of the king\nExcept the Panditrao and Nyayadhis, all other ministers held military commands, their civil duties often being performed by deputies.\n[\n160\n]\n[\n164\n]\nPromotion of Marathi and Sanskrit\nAt his court, Shivaji replaced Persian, the common courtly language in the region, with Marathi, and emphasised Hindu political and courtly traditions. Shivaji's reign stimulated the deployment of Marathi as a systematic tool of description and understanding.\n[\n166\n]\nShivaji's royal seal was in Sanskrit. Shivaji commissioned one of his officials to make a comprehensive lexicon to replace Persian and\nArabic\nterms with their Sanskrit equivalents. This led to the production of the\nRājavyavahārakośa\n, the thesaurus of state usage in 1677.\n[\n167\n]\nReligious policy\nMany modern commentators have deemed Shivaji's religious policies as tolerant. While encouraging Hinduism, Shivaji not only allowed Muslims to practice without harassment, but supported their ministries with endowments.\n[\n168\n]\nNoting that Shivaji had stemmed the spread of the neighbouring Muslim states, his contemporary, the poet\nKavi Bhushan\nstated:\nHad not there been Shivaji, Kashi would have lost its culture, Mathura would have been turned into a mosque and all would have been circumcised.\n[\n169\n]\nHowever, Gijs Kruijtzer, in his book\nXenophobia in Seventeenth-Century India\n, argues that the foundation for modern Hindu-Muslim\ncommunalism\nwas laid in the decade 1677–1687, in the interplay between Shivaji and Aurangzeb (though Shivaji died in 1680).\n[\n170\n]\nDuring the sack of Surat in 1664, Shivaji was approached by Ambrose, a\nCapuchin\nfriar who asked him to spare the city's Christians. Shivaji left the Christians untouched, saying \"the Frankish Padrys are good men.\"\n[\n171\n]\nShivaji was not attempting to create a universal Hindu rule. He was tolerant of different religions and believed in syncretism. He urged Aurangzeb to act like Akbar in according respect to Hindu beliefs and places. Shivaji had little trouble forming alliances with the surrounding Muslim nations, even against Hindu powers. He also did not join forces with certain other Hindu powers fighting the Mughals, such as the Rajputs.\n[\ng\n]\nHis own army had Muslim leaders from early on. The first Pathan unit was formed in 1656. His admiral, Darya Sarang, was a Muslim.\n[\n173\n]\nBakhar dedicated to Shivaji\nWritings of\nModi Script\n. line 2 is from the time of Shivaji\nRamdas\nShivaji was a contemporary of\nSamarth Ramdas\n. Historian\nStewart Gordon\nconcludes about their relationship:\nOlder Maratha histories asserted that Shivaji was a close follower of Ramdas, a Brahmin teacher, who guided him in an orthodox Hindu path; recent research has shown that Shivaji did not meet or know Ramdas until late in his life. Rather, Shivaji followed his own judgement throughout his remarkable career.\n[\n9\n]\nSeal\nRoyal seal of Shivaji\nSeals were a means to confer authenticity on official documents. Shahaji and Jijabai had Persian seals. But Shivaji, right from the beginning, used Sanskrit for his seal.\n[\n167\n]\nThe seal proclaims: \"This seal of Shiva, son of Shah, shines forth for the welfare of the people and is meant to command increasing respect from the universe like the first phase of the moon.\"\n[\n174\n]\nMode of warfare\nShivaji maintained a small but effective standing army. The core of Shivaji's army consisted of peasants of Maratha and\nKunbi\ncastes.\n[\n175\n]\nShivaji was aware of the limitations of his army. He realised that conventional warfare methods were inadequate to confront the big, well-trained cavalry of the Mughals, which was equipped with field artillery. As a result, Shivaji mastered\nguerilla tactics\nwhich became known as\nGanimi Kawa\nin the\nMarathi language\n.\n[\n176\n]\n[\n177\n]\nHis strategies consistently perplexed and defeated armies sent against him. He realized that the most vulnerable point of the large, slow-moving armies of the time was supply. He utilised knowledge of the local terrain and the superior mobility of his light cavalry to cut off supplies to the enemy.\n[\n172\n]\nShivaji refused to confront the enemy in pitched battles. Instead, he lured the enemies into difficult hills and jungles of his own choosing, catching them at a disadvantage and routing them. Shivaji did not adhere to a particular tactic but used several methods to undermine his enemies, as required by circumstances, such as sudden raids, sweeps and ambushes, and psychological warfare.\n[\n178\n]\nShivaji was contemptuously called a \"Mountain Rat\" by\nAurangzeb\nand his generals, because of his guerilla tactics of attacking enemy forces and then retreating into his mountain forts.\n[\n179\n]\n[\n180\n]\n[\n83\n]\nMilitary\nShivaji demonstrated great skill in creating his military organisation, which lasted until the demise of the Maratha Empire. His strategy rested on leveraging his ground forces, naval forces, and series of forts across his territory. The\nMaval\ninfantry served as the core of his ground forces (reinforced by Telangi musketeers from Karnataka) and supported by Maratha cavalry. His artillery was relatively underdeveloped and reliant on European suppliers, further inclining him to a very mobile form of warfare.\n[\n181\n]\nHill forts\nSuvela Machi\n, view of southern sub-plateaux, as seen from\nBallekilla\n,\nRajgad\nMain article:\nShivaji's forts\nHill forts played a key role in Shivaji's strategy. Ramchandra Amatya, one of Shivaji's ministers,  describes the achievement of Shivaji by saying that his empire was created from forts.\n[\n182\n]\nShivaji captured important Adilshahi forts at Murambdev (\nRajgad\n),\nTorna\n, Kondhana (\nSinhagad\n), and\nPurandar\n. He also rebuilt or repaired many forts in advantageous locations.\n[\n183\n]\nIn addition, Shivaji built a number of forts, numbering 111 according to some accounts, but it is likely the actual number \"did not exceed 18.\"\n[\n184\n]\nThe historian\nJadunath Sarkar\nassessed that Shivaji owned some 240–280 forts at the time of his death.\n[\n185\n]\nEach was placed under three officers of equal status, lest a single traitor be bribed or tempted to deliver it to the enemy. The officers acted jointly and provided mutual checks and balances.\n[\n186\n]\nNavy\nMain article:\nMaratha Navy\nSindudurg Fort\nprovided anchorages for Shivaji's Navy\nAware of the need for naval power to maintain control along the\nKonkan\ncoast, Shivaji began to build his navy in 1657 or 1659, with the purchase of twenty\ngalivats\nfrom the Portuguese shipyards of\nBassein\n.\n[\n187\n]\nMarathi chronicles state that at its height his fleet counted some 400 warships, although contemporary English chronicles counter that the number never exceeded 160.\n[\n188\n]\nWith the Marathas being accustomed to a land-based military, Shivaji widened his search for qualified crews for his ships, taking on lower-caste Hindus of the coast who were long familiar with naval operations (the famed \"Malabar pirates\"), as well as Muslim mercenaries.\n[\n188\n]\nNoting the power of the Portuguese navy, Shivaji hired a number of Portuguese sailors and Goan Christian converts, and made Rui Leitao Viegas commander of his fleet. Viegas was later to defect back to the Portuguese, taking 300 sailors with him.\n[\n189\n]\nShivaji fortified his coastline by seizing coastal forts and refurbishing them. He built his first marine fort at\nSindhudurg\n, which was to become the headquarters of the Maratha navy.\n[\n190\n]\nThe navy itself was a\ncoastal navy\n, focused on travel and combat in the littoral areas, and not intended for the\nhigh seas\n.\n[\n191\n]\n[\n192\n]\nLegacy\nAn early-20th-century painting by\nM. V. Dhurandhar\nof Shivaji and\nBaji Prabhu\nat Pawan Khind\nShivaji was well known for his secularism, warrior code of ethics, and exemplary character.\n[\n193\n]\nContemporaneous view\nShivaji was admired for his heroic exploits and clever stratagems in the contemporary accounts of English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and Italian writers.\n[\n194\n]\nContemporary English writers compared him with\nAlexander\n,\nHannibal\n, and\nJulius Caesar\n.\n[\n195\n]\nThe French traveller\nFrancois Bernier\nwrote in his\nTravels in Mughal India\n:\n[\n196\n]\nI forgot to mention that during pillage of Sourate, Seva-Gy, the Holy Seva-Gi! respected the habitation of the Reverend Father Ambrose, the\nCapuchin\nmissionary. 'The Frankish Padres are good men', he said 'and shall not be attacked.' He spared also the house of a deceased Delale or Gentile broker, of the Dutch, because assured that he had been very charitable while alive.\nMughal\ndepictions of Shivaji were largely negative, referring to him simply as \"Shiva\" without the honorific \"\n-ji\n\". One Mughal writer in the early 1700s described Shivaji's death as\nkafir\nbi jahannum raft\n(\nlit.\n'\nthe infidel went to Hell\n'\n).\n[\n197\n]\nHis chivalrous treatment of enemies and women has been praised by Mughal authors, including Khafi Khan. Jadunath Sarkar writes:\n[\n13\n]\nHis chivalry to women and strict enforcement of morality in his camp was a wonder in that age and has extorted the admiration of hostile critics like Khafi Khan.\nEarly depictions\nThe earliest depictions of Shivaji by authors not affiliated with Maratha court in Maharashtra are to be found in the\nbakhars\nthat depict Shivaji as an almost divine figure, an ideal Hindu king who overthrew Muslim dominion. The current academic consensus is that while these Bakhars are important for understanding how Shivaji was viewed in his time, they must be correlated with other sources to decide historical truth.\nSabhasad Bakhar\nand\n91 Kalami Bakhar\nare considered the most reliable of all bakhars by scholars.\n[\n83\n]\nNineteenth century\nA miniature Bronze statue of Shivaji in the collection of the\nShri Bhavani Museum of Aundh\nIn the mid–19th century, Marathi social reformer\nJyotirao Phule\nwrote his interpretation of the Shivaji legend, portraying him as a hero of the\nshudras\nand\ndalits\n. Phule's 1869 ballad-form story of Shivaji was met with great hostility by the Brahmin-dominated media.\n[\n198\n]\nIn 1895, the Indian nationalist leader\nBal Gangadhar Tilak\norganised what was to be an annual festival to mark the birthday of Shivaji.\n[\n18\n]\nHe portrayed Shivaji as the \"opponent of the oppressor\", with possible negative implications concerning the colonial government.\n[\n199\n]\nTilak denied any suggestion that his festival was anti-Muslim or disloyal to the government, but simply a celebration of a hero.\n[\n200\n]\nThese celebrations prompted a British commentator in 1906 to note: \"Cannot the annals of the Hindu race point to a single hero whom even the tongue of slander will not dare call a chief of\ndacoits\n...?\"\n[\n201\n]\nOne of the first commentators to reappraise the critical British view of Shivaji was\nM. G. Ranade\n, whose\nRise of the Maratha Power\n(1900) declared Shivaji's achievements as the beginning of modern nation-building. Ranade criticised earlier British portrayals of Shivaji's state as \"a freebooting power, which thrived by plunder and adventure, and succeeded only because it was the most cunning and adventurous ... This is a very common feeling with the readers, who derive their knowledge of these events solely from the works of English historians.\"\n[\n202\n]\nIn 1919,\nSarkar\npublished the seminal Shivaji and His Times. Sarkar was able to read primary sources in Persian, Marathi, and Arabic, but was challenged for his criticism of the \"chauvinism\" of Marathi historians' views of Shivaji.\n[\n203\n]\nLikewise, although supporters cheered his depiction of the killing of\nAfzal Khan\nas justified, they decried Sarkar's terming as \"murder\" the killing of the\nHindu\nraja\nChandrao More and his clan.\n[\n204\n]\nIn 1937,\nDennis Kincaid\n, a British civil servant in India, published\nThe Grand Rebel\n.\n[\n205\n]\nThis book portrays Shivaji as a heroic rebel and a master strategist fighting a much larger Mughal army.\n[\n83\n]\nPost independence\nStatue of Shivaji at\nRaigad Fort\nIn modern times, Shivaji is considered as a national hero in India,\n[\n206\n]\n[\n207\n]\n[\n208\n]\nespecially in the state of Maharashtra, where he remains an important figure in the state's history. Stories of his life form an integral part of the upbringing and identity of the\nMarathi people\n.\n[\n209\n]\nHindutva\nactivists are noted for appropriating Shivaji by presenting him as \"Hindu king\" who \"fought against Muslim rulers\", contrary to historic accounts that show he belonged to a marginalised caste and held secular values.\n[\n210\n]\n[\n211\n]\n[\n212\n]\nPolitical parties\nIn 1966, the\nShiv Sena\n(\nlit.\n'\nArmy of Shivaji\n'\n) political party was formed to promote the interests of Marathi-speaking people in the face of migration to Maharashtra from other parts of India, and the accompanying loss of power of locals. His image adorns literature, propaganda, and icons of the party.\n[\n213\n]\nShivaji is seen as a hero by regional political parties and also by the Maratha-caste-dominated\nIndian National Congress\nand the\nNationalist Congress Party\n.\n[\n214\n]\nControversies related to Shivaji's depiction\nIn the late 20th century,\nBabasaheb Purandare\nbecame one of the most significant authors in portraying Shivaji in his writings, leading him to be declared in 1964 as the\nShiv-Shahir\n(\nlit.\n'\nBard of Shivaji\n'\n).\n[\n215\n]\n[\n216\n]\nHowever, Purandare, a Brahmin, was also accused of overstating the influence of Brahmin gurus on Shivaji,\n[\n214\n]\nand his\nMaharashtra Bhushan\naward ceremony in 2015 was protested by those claiming he had defamed Shivaji.\n[\n217\n]\nIn 1993, the\nIllustrated Weekly\npublished an article suggesting that Shivaji was not opposed to Muslims\nper se\n, and that his style of governance was influenced by that of the Mughal Empire. Congress Party members called for legal actions against the publisher and writer, Marathi newspapers accused them of \"imperial prejudice\", and\nShiv Sena\ncalled for the writer's public flogging. Maharashtra brought legal action against the publisher under regulations prohibiting enmity between religious and cultural groups, but a High Court found that the\nIllustrated Weekly\nhad operated within the bounds of freedom of expression.\n[\n218\n]\n[\n219\n]\nStatue of Shivaji opposite the\nGateway of India\nin\nSouth Mumbai\nIn 2003, the American academic\nJames W. Laine\npublished his book\nShivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India\nto, what\nAnanya Vajpeyi\nterms, a regime of \"cultural policing by militant Marathas\".\n[\n220\n]\n[\n221\n]\nAs a result of this publication, the\nBhandarkar Oriental Research Institute\n, in Pune, where Laine had done research, was attacked by the\nSambhaji Brigade\n.\n[\n222\n]\n[\n223\n]\nLaine was even threatened with arrest,\n[\n220\n]\nand the book was banned in\nMaharashtra\nin January 2004. The ban was lifted by the\nBombay High Court\nin 2007, and in July 2010 the\nSupreme Court of India\nupheld the lifting of the ban.\n[\n224\n]\nThis lifting was followed by public demonstrations against the author and the decision of the Supreme Court.\n[\n225\n]\n[\n226\n]\nCommemorations\nStatues of Shivaji are found in every\ntaluka\nin Maharashtra\n[\n227\n]\n[\n228\n]\nas well as in many places across India, including Mumbai,\n[\n229\n]\nPune\n,\n[\n228\n]\nNew Delhi\n,\n[\n230\n]\nSurat\n,\n[\n231\n]\nand\nYellur\n.\n[\n232\n]\nThere are also statues outside of India including in\nSan Jose, California\n,\n[\n233\n]\nand\nMauritius\n.\n[\n234\n]\nA replica of\nRaigad Fort\nbuilt by children on occasion of Diwali as a tribute to Shivaji.\nSeveral Mumbai landmarks were renamed for Shivaji in the 1990s, around the same time that Bombay was renamed Mumbai.\n[\n235\n]\nThe Prince of Wales Museum, which is devoted to Indian history, was renamed\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya\n.\n[\n235\n]\nVictoria Terminus, Mumbai's main railway station and the headquarters of the\nCentral Railway zone\n,\n[\n236\n]\nwas initially renamed\nChhatrapati Shivaji Terminus\nand later renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus.\n[\n237\n]\nSimilarly, Mumbai's busiest airport, Sahar International Airport, was first renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport and further renamed to\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport\n.\n[\n238\n]\nOther commemorations include the Indian Navy's\nINS Shivaji\nstation\n[\n239\n]\nand numerous\npostage stamps\n.\n[\n240\n]\nIn 2022, the Indian prime minister unveiled the new ensign of the\nIndian Navy\n, which was inspired by the seal of Shivaji.\n[\n241\n]\nIn Maharashtra, there has been a long tradition of children building replica forts with toy soldiers and other figures during the festival of\nDiwali\n, in memory of Shivaji.\n[\n242\n]\n[\n243\n]\nA proposal to build a giant memorial called\nShiv Smarak\nwas approved in 2016; the memorial is to be located near Mumbai on a small island in the Arabian Sea. It will be 210 metres (690 ft) tall, which will make it the\nworld's tallest statue\nwhen completed.\n[\n244\n]\nAs of August 2021, the project has been stalled since January 2019, due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n. Only the\nbathymetry\nsurvey has been completed, while the\ngeotechnical survey\nwas underway. Consequently, the state public works department proposed extending the completion date by a year, from 18 October 2021 to 18 October 2022.\n[\n245\n]\nSources\nNotes\n^\nBased on multiple committees of historians and experts, the Government of Maharashtra accepts 19 February 1630 as his birthdate. This\nJulian calendar\ndate  of that period (1 March 1630 of today's\nGregorian calendar\n) corresponds\n[\n21\n]\nto the\nHindu calendar\nbirth date from contemporary records.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nOther suggested dates include 6 April 1627 or dates near this day.\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\n^\nA decade earlier, Afzal Khan, in a parallel situation, had arrested a Hindu general during a truce ceremony.\n[\n58\n]\n^\nJadunath Sarkar after weighing all recorded evidence in this behalf, has settled the point \"that Afzal Khan struck the first blow\" and that \"Shivaji committed.... a preventive murder. It was a case of a diamond cut diamond.\" The conflict between Shivaji and Bijapur was essentially political in nature, and not communal.\n[\n60\n]\n^\nMost of the great Maratha Jahagirdar families in the service of Adilshahi strongly opposed Shivaji in his early years. These included families such as the Ghadge, More, Mohite, Ghorpade, Shirke, and Nimbalkar.\n[\n117\n]\n^\nVarna\nis sometimes also termed\nVarnashrama Dharma\n^\nAs for the cause of his death, the Bombay Council's letter dated 28 April 1680 says: \"We have certain news that Shivaji Rajah is dead. It is now 23 days since he deceased, it is said of a bloody flux, being sick 12 days.\" A contemporaneous Portuguese document states that Shivaji died of anthrax. However, none of these sources provides sufficient details to draw a definite conclusion. The Sabhasad Chronicle states that the King died of fever, while some versions of the A.K. Chronicle state that he died of \"navjvar\" (possibly typhoid).\n[\n157\n]\n^\nShivaji was not attempting to create a universal Hindu rule. Over and over, he espoused tolerance and syncretism. He even called on Aurangzeb to act like Akbar in according respect to Hindu beliefs and places. Shivaji had no difficulty in allying with the Muslim states which surrounded him – Bijapur, Golconda, and the Mughals – even against Hindu powers, such as the nayaks of the Karnatic. Further, he did not ally with other Hindu powers, such as the Rajputs, rebelling against the Mughals.\n[\n172\n]\nReferences\n^\na\nb\nSardesai 1957\n, p. 222.\n^\na\nb\nSatish Chandra (1982).\nMedieval India: Society, the Jagirdari Crisis, and the Village\n.

  "rewritten": "## Shivaji Maharaj\n\n**Shivaji Maharaj (c. 1630 – 1680), also known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian warrior-king and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan. He is widely considered one of the greatest warriors of his time and is revered for laying the foundation of an independent Maratha kingdom. Shivaji challenged the dominance of the Mughal Empire and other established powers in the Indian subcontinent through his military strategies, innovative governance, and unwavering commitment to his people.**\n\n**Key Facts:**\n\n*   **Full Name:** Shivaji Bhonsle Maharaj\n*   **Titles:** *Chhatrapati* (sovereign), *Hindustavi Swarajya Sansthapak* (Founder of the Hindavi Swarajya - self-rule of Indian people)\n*   **Birth:** Estimated to be February 19, 1630, in Shivneri Fort, Junnar, present-day Maharashtra, India.\n*   **Death:** April 3, 1680, Raigad Fort, present-day Maharashtra, India.\n*   **Reign:** Officially crowned *Chhatrapati* in 1674, though his influence and control extended significantly before and after this period.\n*   **Dynasty:** Bhonsle\n*   **Father:** Shahaji Bhonsle\n*   **Mother:** Jijabai\n*   **Capital:** Raigad\n*   **Significance:** Renowned for his military prowess, strategic brilliance, administrative reforms, and his role in fostering a sense of Maratha identity and independence. He is celebrated for his opposition to Mughal rule and his establishment of a strong and autonomous Maratha state.\n\n**Early Life and Rise to Power: From Challenge to Kingdom**\n\nShivaji Maharaj did not inherit a pre-existing kingdom; he established it through strategic military campaigns and astute diplomacy. He was born into a period when much of India was under the control of the Mughal Empire and various Sultanates. However, he envisioned a sovereign and independent future for the Maratha people and the region.\n\n*   **Family Background:** Shivaji was born into the Bhonsle family, a respected Maratha clan. While he benefited from the network and resources available to his family, his leadership and ambition were largely self-driven. His father, Shahaji, was a Maratha general serving under different rulers, including the Adilshahi Sultanate of Bijapur and the Nizamshahi Sultanate of Ahmednagar. His mother, Jijabai, played a pivotal role in shaping his values, instilling in him a sense of duty and a vision for Maratha self-rule. She ensured he received training in warfare, administration, and statecraft.\n\n*   **Confronting the Bijapur Sultanate:** Shivaji initiated his military career by challenging the authority of the Adilshahi Sultanate of Bijapur. He asserted Maratha claims to the land, employing innovative guerrilla warfare tactics that exploited the region's rugged geography. These tactics included surprise attacks, strategic ambushes, and a deep understanding of the terrain. He skillfully captured key forts, such as Torna, Chakan, and Kondana (later renamed Sinhagad), which served as crucial strongholds and laid the foundation for his expanding kingdom. These early victories demonstrated his military acumen and challenged the established power structures of the region.",
